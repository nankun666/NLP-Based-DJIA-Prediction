# NLP-Based-DJIA-Prediction
## Introduction
This study investigates the potential relationship between financial news headlines and stock market trends, aiming to determine whether sentiment and content within headlines can predict market movements. Using a comprehensive dataset of financial news and corresponding market indices, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are applied to quantify sentiment and extract key themes. Statistical analysis and machine learning models were employed to evaluate the predictive power of headline sentiment on stock price trends. Preliminary results indicate a significant correlation between news sentiment and short-term market fluctuations, offering valuable insights for investors and analysts seeking to integrate news data into trading strategies.
## Motivations of Research Question
The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) asserts that stock prices fully incorporate all available information at any point in time. Under this theory, new information—such as economic reports, corporate earnings, or geopolitical events—is immediately reflected in stock prices, assuming rational investors have equal access to information (Fama, 1997). Traditional financial analysis often emphasizes structured numerical data, such as historical prices or financial ratios. However, unstructured news text contains valuable contextual information, including sentiment, tone, emerging developments, and implicit signals, which may not be captured through quantitative indicators alone. The advancements in Natural Language Processing, particularly tools like sentiment analysis and word importance techniques, have created opportunities to analyze textual data and identify patterns or signals relevant to financial markets.
This research explores whether unstructured financial news holds predictive power over stock price movement. Specifically, the investigation focuses on the following questions:
1. Can textual features—such as sentiment, word importance, and Named Entity Recognition —effectively predict whether the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) will rise or fall?
2. What types of news and specific keywords influence stock prices, and how do these factors manifest in price changes?
Uncovering meaningful relationships between news content and stock price behavior has the potential to provide valuable insights for refining trading strategies, enhancing market analysis, and deepening the understanding of how unstructured information drives financial decision-making.
## Dataset Description
The research is based on three key datasets: Reddit News, which compiles news headlines from Reddit; Combined News DJIA, a consolidated dataset of news headlines with an indicator on the price movement of DJIA; and DJIA Table, which provides historical performance data for the DJIA. The main focus will be on the Combined News DJIA and DJIA Table which have the necessary features and labels to conduct the research. A key column to highlight is the Label column in DJIA Table, which is a binary indicator: a value of 1 signifies that the DJIA price increased or remained the same, while a value of 0 indicates a decrease.
## Data Preprocessing
To prepare the datasets for analysis, several preprocessing steps are applied. Firstly, data cleaning is performed by converting all news headlines to lowercase, removing stopwords, and eliminating punctuations and special characters to standardize the text. Tokenization is then performed to split the news headlines into individual tokens. Lemmatization is applied using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer, which reduces words to their base forms while leaving those unchanged that are not found in the WordNet corpus. Once the text preprocessing is complete, the news headline dataset is merged with the stock price dataset, enabling the integration of textual features with a corresponding stock market movement for the modeling process. The combined dataset is then split into two subsets: 80% for training and 20% for testing, ensuring reliable model evaluation.
## Methods Description
Feature extraction and engineering techniques were applied to prepare the text data for analysis. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) was used to transform textual data into numerical features by emphasizing term importance, while sentiment scores—Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Compound—were generated using the VADER model to capture the emotional tone of the text. Named Entity Recognition (NER) was employed to extract meaningful entities, such as organizations, adding further context to the data. Lagged sentiment features were introduced to identify temporal patterns and improve predictive accuracy. Machine learning models, including Random Forest with SMOTE to address class imbalance, Logistic Regression with hyperparameter tuning, Naive Bayes incorporating NER features, and Linear Regression to infer relationships between features and DJIA, were implemented. To address high dimensionality, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to streamline the feature space while retaining essential information for model training and evaluation.
## Practical Implication
This project holds significant implications across various areas. It enhances risk management by providing a deeper understanding of how specific words of news impact stock prices, allowing investors to adapt their strategies in real time and mitigate potential risks. It also contributes to algorithmic trading, where sentiment analysis can be integrated into trading algorithms to refine decision-making processes and optimize trade execution based on shifting market sentiment trends. Furthermore, financial analysts can leverage these insights to fine-tune their market predictions. This, in turn, leads to more informed and data-driven recommendations for clients, empowering them to make better investment decisions.
